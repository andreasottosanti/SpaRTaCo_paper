# SpaRTaCo_paper
This repository contains the scripts to reproduce the simulations and the analysis shown in the paper '*Co-clustering of Spatially Resolved Transcriptomic Data*' by Andrea Sottosanti and Davide Risso. [(link)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04872)


## Reproduce the simulation experiments
To reproduce the spatial experiments proposed in the article, you can run the files contained into the directory `.../Create_Simulations`. Every file will save multiple replicas of the experiments according to the values of `n_replicas`. You need to specify a directory where to save the simulations.
